    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "\n",
    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like. In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve.

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "The time required to train the Support Vector Machine is more than 2 minutes for each group of samples (1%, 10%, and 100% of the given data). It is less than 1 second for the Logistic Regression and Random Forest algorithms. The time required to produce predictions (using 1%, 10%, and 100% of the given data) with Support Vector Machine is about 20 seconds. It is a fraction of a second for the other two algorithms. Reject the Support Vector Machine because of its slower performance. If our organization is going to evaluate prospective donors only infrequently (maybe our pool changes slowly, maybe we run a batch job semi-annually), then reconsider this decision. \n",

    "The accuracy statistics and F-scores on the test data for all 3 models are very similar.The Random Forest appears to yield a very slightly higher F-score. On the training data, the accuracy and F-score numbers are higher with the Random Forest than with Logistic Regression or Support Vector Machine. Let's go with the Random Forest. The F-score statistic gives greater weight to precision than it does to recall. We will be spending money to send development officers to visit with potential donors. We want to be sure that a prospect that our model tells us is promising really is promising, so that we are not entertaining people who lack the means and inclination to support us with a significant gift. We will not be able to visit all prospects. Missing some promising prospects will not reduce the success of fund-raising efforts if our model gives our development officers plenty of good prospects to call. "

    "We will use the Random Forest algorithm to determine whether or not a prospect has a high income. The algorithm develops a rule for classification from an analysis of records that include characteristics of some set of prospects, including their incomes. With this rule, it can classify new prospects whose incomes are not known. This algorithm builds several independent Decision Trees. Each tree casts a vote. The Random Forest lets the majority determine the final decision. A Decision Tree is like the guidebook that enables an amateur naturalist to distinguish an oak from a maple and a spruce from a fir. It solves a problem by asking a series of yes/no questions: do we see leaves or needles? are the needles flat or not?\n",

    "The algorithm builds each Decision Tree by examining a randomly selected subset of all of the examples (prospects whose incomes and features are known) that we have been given and by selecting a subset of features in these examples. This is a way of building independent trees. Independence is the key. Little is learned by asking many people who think alike to vote, but if (to make an analogy) each naturalist on a hike has glimpsed different features of birds (short bill or not? patch on throat or not?) and each has seen different birds of the same species, then a vote will allow a more confident identification of the species when they all look at a new bird. Our algorithm expresses questions not in words but with mathematics that assigns a positive or negative value to each record, adjusts the formula until it separates the records well, and then repeats by guessing a new formula to refine that division."

    "- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.\n",
    " - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",

People acquire wealth through work, discipline, and savings and investment over time, and so have wealth only in their later years. A stable family life and commitments to family appear to be common traits among the most successful. Education and choice of occupation are important, but not limiting---people with modest academic aptitudes and  achievement build fortunes, and often do so in businesses that offer little glamour or prestige. Some nations have created environments that make it easier to create businesses and some nations are more attractive to those who have the means to live where they would like.\n",

    "#### A feature in my list but not in the software-generated list\n",
    "\n",
    "I had supposed that national origin might be an important variable, but this list does not include native-county. I think this is because I confused where a person currently lives with where a person was born. I expect that the relationship of national origin to income is complicated. For example, there is persistent poverity within some segments of the native population of the United States and also high representation of immigrants among the nation's entrepreneurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A feature not in my list but in the software-generated list\n",
    "\n",
    "I had left capital-gain out of my list. I think that this feature is a measure of wealth. I expected a correlation between wealth and income, but from my reading in \"The Millionaire Next Door\" I had learned that many people with modest salaries accumulate stakes in real estate or small businesses that are worth millions of dollars. These people, I thought, might have high capital gains while taking home wages that put them in the middle class.   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features in both my list and the software-generated list\n",
    "\n",
    "I had supposed that married people would make up a disproportionately large fraction of the high earners. The software confirms this by including both Marital-status/Married-civ-spouse and relationship/Husband in the list of 5 most heavily weighted features. In my reading, I have encountered arguments that the support of a family makes it easier to invest in a career and thereby earn a high income. I have also read speculation that the desire to provide for a family spurs many people to work harder.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had supposed that age (for reasons that I gave in my answer to Question 6) would be a factor and the software confirms this.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose a different measure of education than did the software. I chose educational attainment (the kind of degree earned) while the software picked number of years of schooling. I had thought the completion of 3 years of a 4 year undergraduate program did not increase a person's earning capacity very much. Certainly, I thought, taking more than 4 years to earn the baccalaureate degree does not increase earning capacity. So, I do not have a good explanation of why the one measure of education is a more important predictor.\n",

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "The model with reduced data produces statistics close to those obtained previously with the unoptimized model.

I am going to stick with that judgment here: I recommend using all features to build our model.\n",

    "I work in higher education and have seen how non-profit organizations solicit donations. The donor pool at a small college typically includes a few tens of thousands of living alumni. At a state university, it includes a few hundreds of thousands of living alumni. The size of the pool changes by a few percent per year as the university graduates more students, older alumni die, and the development office loses track of other alumni (because of changes of addresses and employment, for example). An organization might want to retrain its model four times per year. The organization will have better computing resources than the laptop that I have used in making this report for CharityML. Training time will be minutes, maybe hours. Training time will be a small cost for the organization. A better model will have great value for the organization."
